# MachineLearningofCloudOrganisation-MatthewCowardCodeRepository
A repository containing the notebooks relating to Matthew Coward's MA50286 Project: Machine Learning of Cloud Organisation within Climate Models

The notebooks contained within this repository clean and use the COGS dataset available from the ARM website https://www.arm.gov/capabilities/vaps/interpsonde and https://www.arm.gov/capabilities/vaps/cogs

This repository can be considered to contain two types of notebook - firstly, the data proessing code used to compute the cloud perimeter and cloud fraction from the COGS dataset and the code which collocates the atmospheric data with the COGS data and secondly, the code used to train and tune the neural networks.

The avoid the need to refit the models, the final two trained models are also available within the repository
